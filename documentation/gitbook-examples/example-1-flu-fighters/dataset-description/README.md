# Dataset Description

The dataset contains **predictor variables** (baseline immune data, demographics, and transcriptomics) and **outcome variables** (vaccine responsiveness).

### Predictor variables

These variables comprise demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, ethnicity) and pre-vaccination immune features measured before vaccine administration (baseline).

<summary><strong>ðŸ§¬ Baseline Immune Features</strong></summary>



* **Blood Transcriptomics**: Pathway activity captured by **Gene Ontology (GO)** terms, e.g., `blood_baseline_go.0006415` (translation).

- **Nasal Transcriptomics**: Pathway activity in nasal samples, e.g., `nasal_baseline_go.0006968` (defense response to virus).

* **Immune Cell Subsets**:
  * `v0_mdcs`: Myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs).
  * `v0_pdcs`: Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs).
  * `v0_classical_monocytes`, `v0_intermediate_monocytes`, `v0_nonclassical_monocytes`: Monocyte subsets.
* **T cell Cytokine Production:**
  * `v0_cd4` : Measure of cytokine production by CD4+ T cells in response to influenza antigens
  * `v0_cd8` : Measure of cytokine production by CD8+ T cells in response to influenza antigens
  * Further classified by cytokines measured (`ifng`, `il2`) cells and the associated influenza strains (`h3`, `hmnp`, `hab`, `bmnp`)
    * ie. `h1_v0_cd4_ifng`,  `h3_v0_cd4_il2`

- **Viral and Bacterial Load**:
  * `v0_resp_virus_positive`: Presence of 14 different respiratory viruses (flu, adenoviruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, etc.) detected via RT-PCR at baseline.
  * `v0_pneumo_ng_log10copies_ul`: Nasal _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ density (log10 copies per ÂµL).
- **Nutrition Status:**
  * `z_score_continuous`: Weight-for-height Z-score (nutritional status).

### Outcome variables

These variables measure vaccine-induced immune responses across humoral, cellular, and mucosal immunity. Fold change corresponds to the magnitude change between measurements at baseline and measurements 21 days post-vaccination.

* `h1_hai_gmt_fold_change`: Responsiveness in HAI titers for H1N1 (serum antibody response blocking virus-host interaction).

- `h3_hai_gmt_fold_change`: Responsiveness in HAI titers for H3N2.

* `ph1n1_ha_iga_fold_change`: Responsiveness in mucosal IgA binding to H1N1 hemagglutinin.
