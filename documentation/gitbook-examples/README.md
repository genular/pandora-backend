# Intro

Use [this workflow](flu-fighters-workflow/) to explore how baseline immune features can predict responses to the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV). **The main objective is to classify participants as “high” or “low” responders based on changes in immune markers post-vaccination.**

Link to example dataset:

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/flu_fighters.csv" %}

The dataset contains data from **244 children** (aged 2–5 years) vaccinated with LAIV. Your task is to predict **vaccine responsiveness** (immunogenicity) based on **baseline immune features**. Responsiveness reflects how well a vaccine elicits an immune response, spanning humoral, cellular, and mucosal immunity.

For more details, refer to the publication that describes this cohort:\
