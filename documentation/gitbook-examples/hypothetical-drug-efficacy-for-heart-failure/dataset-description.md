# Dataset Description

The dataset contains **input features** (Objective, Examination, Subjective) and a **target variable** indicating the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease. For our hypothetical trial, we will add a `TreatmentGroup` column.

#### Input Features (Baseline & Examination)

These variables are measured at baseline or during examination periods.

<summary><strong>üë§ Objective Features</strong></summary>

* `PatientID` (Hypothetical): Unique identifier for each patient.
* `Age`: Age | int (days)
* `Height`: Height | int (cm)
* `Weight`: Weight | float (kg)
* `Gender`: Gender | categorical code (e.g., 1 for male, 2 for female, or similar coding)
* `TreatmentGroup` (Hypothetical, added for the trial): Assigned treatment (`CardioGuard` or `Placebo`). **This is the key variable for assessing drug efficacy.**
