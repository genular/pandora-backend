# Flu Fighters Workflow

In this workflow, you will learn how to use PANDORA to create and analyze a predictive model using the Flu Fighter dataset. Youâ€™ll begin by preparing the dataset for use with PANDORA, then explore key tools in the Discovery section, which includes [Data Overview](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9LdC62ZpkxqvCBTPwVZU/data-analysis/discovery/data-overview), [Correlation](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9LdC62ZpkxqvCBTPwVZU/data-analysis/discovery/correlation), [t-SNE Analysis](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9LdC62ZpkxqvCBTPwVZU/data-analysis/discovery/t-sne-analysis), and [Hierarchical Clustering](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9LdC62ZpkxqvCBTPwVZU/data-analysis/discovery/hierarchical-clustering). You will then learn how to build and evaluate predictive models using PANDORA's [Predictive section](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9LdC62ZpkxqvCBTPwVZU/data-analysis/predictive). Each phase of the workflow is outlined below.

Define the responder column to be used in the predictive analysis via method A or method B

1. **Method A**
   1. Define responder classification via clustering with t-SNE
2. **Method B**
   1. Manually define responder classification based on a  biological threshold

Ensure your model isn't biased by checking for any potential confounding demographic variables

1. **Set Up Confounding Analysis**
   * Configure t-SNE analysis for confounding variable check.
2. **Check for Confounding**
   * Analyze resulting t-SNE plots and check the distribution of confounding variables in responder classifications.
3. **Additional Analysis**
   * Further analysis in the case that the confounding variable distribution among responder classifications is unclear on the t-SNE plot.
