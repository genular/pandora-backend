# Phase 1: Data overview

The aim is to assess the different data types within the dataset, view their distributions for preliminary exploration, and inspect missing values, which is especially common in longitudinal studies.&#x20;



<details>

<summary>1) Launch PANDORA</summary>

1. Open Docker and start the PANDORA container&#x20;

1. Open Your Terminal:
   * On Windows, search for **PowerShell** in your Start menu and open it.

    ```
    {% endcode %}

<summary>2) Data upload and plot</summary>

1. Navigate to [**Workspace**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9LdC62ZpkxqvCBTPwVZU/general/workspace)&#x20;
2. Upload the `covid_pitch.csv` file onto  Workspace&#x20;
3. Select the uploaded dataset&#x20;

4. Navigate to [Data Overview](https://app.gitbook.com/s/9LdC62ZpkxqvCBTPwVZU/data-analysis/discovery/data-overview) by going to **Discovery -> Start -> Data overview**&#x20;

5. Select up to 5 variables for visualizing data distributions
   1. The first variable will be selected as the sorting variable&#x20;
   2. **Identify key columns**: In this study, the data can be divided into several important categories- `Donor ID`, `Timepoints`, immunological assays, demographics, clinical symptoms, `Disease severity` and `Responders` . Hence, aim to view distributions that are representative of these categories&#x20;
   3. **Missing values (NA)**:  The number of missing values in each feature is provided during column selection. A star next to the number of NAs indicates that <10% of the values are NA in that feature
   4. In this example, the day sample was acquired after positive SARS-CoV-2 test (`Timepoint`) is used as the sorting variable and compared to severity of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms experienced (`Disease severity`),  outcome of immune response durability at 6 months (`Responder`), and concentrations of immunoglobin G antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (`S-IgG`, `S-IgG memB SARS-CoV2`)

6. After selection of desired features, select 'Plot image', and the distribution and table plots will be generated for the selected columns. You will see plots similar to the ones below:&#x20;

7. Repeat the above steps to produce plots for key categorical variables and numerical assays of interest

<summary>3) Examine <a href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/9LdC62ZpkxqvCBTPwVZU/data-analysis/discovery/data-overview#distribution-plot">distribution plots</a></summary>

This plot displays the frequency and spread of individual variables, hence providing information about skewness, potential outliers, and correlations between variables

Based on the distribution plot generated in our above example,&#x20;

1. The chosen variables consist of both **categorical** and **continuous** variables, as shown by presence of both graphs and histograms along the diagonal.&#x20;
   1. `Timepoint` is a continuous variable with a multimodal distribution
   2. `Disease severity` is a categorical variables shown with two bins, with the first class (asymptomatic) notably less present in the dataset compared to the second class (mild)&#x20;
   3. `Responder` is a categorical variable and there are almost equal numbers of 'low' and 'high' responders
   4. `S-IgG`, `S-IgG memB SARS-CoV2` are continuous variables and their distributions are right-skewed&#x20;
2. There is significant correlation, as highlighted by the red boxes, between:&#x20;
   1. `Timepoint` and `S-IgG`
   2. `S-IgG memB SARS-CoV2` and `S-IgG`
3. The box plots do not portray any highly notable relationships, and the histogram with `Responder` and `Disease severity` (shown in green box) show significantly low numbers of asymptomatic workers who were 'high' responders compared to workers with mild severity, and slightly higher mild workers who were 'low' responders compared to asymptomatic.&#x20;
4. There are significant outliers in the correlation plots, as shown by the blue circles.

<summary>4) Examine <a href="https://app.gitbook.com/s/9LdC62ZpkxqvCBTPwVZU/data-analysis/discovery/data-overview#table-plot">table plots</a></summary>

This plot can be used to visualize distribution patterns for multiple variables together in a single figure, examine missing values and understand data types and unique value counts.

Select the **Table Plot** tab (located left of the Distribution Plot tab)

Based on the table plot generated from our previous example:&#x20;

1. The leftmost variable, `Timepoint` , is the sorting variable, arranging all rows from the largest to the smallest values (starting from bottom to the graph to upwards)&#x20;
2. As stated in the left bottom corner of the graph (highlighted in a red box), there are 100 bins with 4 objects in each bin&#x20;
3. `Disease severity` and `Responder` variables are categorical, as shown by the legend and colored bins&#x20;
   1. There are a notable number of **missing values**  in the `Responder` column (colored in red), which compared to the `Disease severity` plot is highly present in samples taken from workers with **severe** disease symptoms.&#x20;
4. `Timepoint`, `S-IgG`, `S-IgG memB SARS-CoV2` are numerical variables.&#x20;
   1. `Timepoint` has a staircase-type distribution indicating to five discrete timepoints the sample was obtained&#x20;
   2. The distribution of `S-IgG` and  `S-IgG memB SARS-CoV` portrays these variables are more continuous
5. Generally, there is no correlation between timepoints and concentration of spike protein-specific IgG produced from memory B cells.&#x20;
6. `S-IgG`, which is log-transformed, indicating overall spike protein-specific IgG concentration, appears to be higher at the latest timepoint compared to the earliest timepoint&#x20;
7. The samples with highest IgG concentrations in either variable generally corresponds with a high responder&#x20;
