# How to evaluate the model?

### Why do we want to evaluate the model performance?&#x20;

When making a predictive model, especially one that we hope can be used to predict and inform clinical and disease-related measures, we want to make sure that we are confident in the model's ability to make predictions when presented with new data. Hence, it is vital to evaluate a model performance and determine how successful it is using a wide range of parameters that are best applicable to our certain application.&#x20;

### What parameters do you use for model evaluation?&#x20;

One of the first parameters we look at is the AUCROC curves.&#x20;
