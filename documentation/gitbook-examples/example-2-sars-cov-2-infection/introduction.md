# Introduction

Use [this workflow](covid-pitch-workflow/) to explore the durability of humoral and cellular immune responses longitudinally after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The dataset consists of 78 UK health workers who presented with symptomatic or asymptomatic infection prior to vaccination. Samples were collected from the participants over a period of 6 months.&#x20;

The **main objectives** are to:

1. **Visualize the trajectories of diverse immune responses over 6 months** after infection by analyzing how trajectories differ based on initial disease severity and the correlations between different immune parameters
2. **Predict pre-defined long-term antibody responder status based on early immune signatures**

The dataset can be downloaded from this [**Zenodo data repository**](https://zenodo.org/records/4905965) or from below:&#x20;
