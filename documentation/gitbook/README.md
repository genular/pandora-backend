# Welcome to PANDORA

**PANDORA** is a research platform developed and maintained by [aTomic Lab](https://atomic-lab.org/). It is engineered to leverage advanced statistical methodologies, many specifically designed for the analysis of high-dimensional data prevalent in biomedical research. The platform supports predictive modeling, biomarker discovery, and comprehensive OMICS data analysis, thereby contributing to novel insights in systems biology.

**Data exploration and visualization:**

* **Inspect your datasets:** Quickly understand the structure and content of your data.
* **Analyze correlations:** Examine how different variables relate to each other.
* **Perform hierarchical clustering:** Group similar samples or features.
* **Reduce dimensionality and find patterns:** Use techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE, and UMAP to effectively visualize and identify patterns in high-dimensional data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, cytometry data).

**Predictive modeling and biomarker discovery:**

* **Build machine learning models:** The integrated SIMON toolkit helps you develop and run machine learning models more easily.
* **Create models for various applications:** Build models for tasks such as predicting outcomes (like treatment efficacy or patient stratification) and other classification needs.
* **Identify key biomarkers:** Find statistically significant biomarkers that strongly influence your model's predictions.

**Model evaluation and interpretation:**

* **Assess model performance:** Use robust tools like variable importance metrics and ROC curve analysis to evaluate how well your models are working.
* **Understand model predictions:** Employ advanced model interpretation methods, including Explainable AI, to gain insights into why your models make certain predictions.
* **Analyze complex OMICS data:** PANDORA is designed for the robust analysis of OMICS datasets, helping you achieve reliable and reproducible results.
