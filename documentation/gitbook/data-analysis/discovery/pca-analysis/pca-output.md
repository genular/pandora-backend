# PCA Output

This sub-tab provides a direct view of the core numerical results generated by the Principal Component Analysis, typically displayed in a terminal-like output format. It usually shows snippets of the key data tables for eigenvalues, variables, and individuals.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Eigenvalues" %}
This section summarizes the variance associated with each principal component (dimension).

* **Variance:** The eigenvalue for the corresponding dimension (principal component). Represents the amount of variance captured.
* **% of var. (Percent of Variance):** The percentage of the total dataset variance explained by that single dimension.
* **Cumulative % of var. (Cumulative Percent of Variance):** The running total of the variance explained by including the current dimension and all preceding ones.

{% tab title="Individuals" %}
This section shows PCA results for the individual samples (rows), typically displaying the first 10 individuals.

* **Dist:** Often represents the squared distance of the individual from the origin (centroid) in the full principal component space. Can indicate how much an individual deviates overall.
* **Dim.X (e.g., Dim.1, Dim.2):** The coordinate (score) of the individual on that specific principal component (dimension). This determines the sample's position in the PCA plots.
* **ctr (Contribution):** The percentage contribution of that individual to the total variance of that specific principal component. High values indicate influential points for that dimension.
* **cos2 (Quality of Representation):** The quality of representation of the individual on that specific principal component. A value closer to 1 means that dimension captures a large portion of that individual's variance. (Note: This is the cos2 per dimension, while the quality plots often show the sum across selected dimensions).

{% tab title="Variables" %}
This section shows PCA results for the original variables (columns), typically displaying the first 10 variables.

* **Dim.X (e.g., Dim.1, Dim.2):** The coordinate (loading) of the variable on that specific principal component (dimension). Indicates the correlation/relationship between the variable and the PC.
* **ctr (Contribution):** The percentage contribution of that variable to the total variance of that specific principal component. High values indicate variables that strongly define that dimension.
* **cos2 (Quality of Representation):** The quality of representation of the variable on that specific principal component. A value closer to 1 means that dimension captures a large portion of that variable's variance.
