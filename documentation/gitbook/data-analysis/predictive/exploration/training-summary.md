### Key Functionalities

1. **Model Comparison**
   * **Select models:** Choose models from the dataset for performance metric comparison. Two or more models must be selected to view a training summary
   * **Box Plots:** Visually shows the distribution of data and skewness for each model selected in the comparison
   * Performance Measurements:&#x20;
   * **Model Fitting Result Summaries:** Provides a summary of model performance data via tables for each metric. Each table lists the selected models as rows and the five-number summary of each model's dataset in the columns.
2. **Data Exportation**
   * **Copy:** Save the results for Performance Measurements and the Model Fitting Result Summaries by copying from Pandora and pasting into a separate file.
   * **Download:** Export the box plots to a .svg file&#x20;
