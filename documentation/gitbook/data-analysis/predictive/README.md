# Predictive

The **Predictive** section allows users to create predictive models for complex datasets and explore the underlying features behind their performance. It is designed for ease of use when developing predictive models, and provides a suite of tools to assess and compare model performance as well as provide insights on feature contributions. The Predictive Section can be broken into two primary tabs, one focused on predictive model creation, and the other focused on model performance
