# Feature Selection

Feature selection is a critical preprocessing step in machine learning, aimed at identifying and retaining the most informative subset of predictors (features) from the original dataset for model training. Its objectives typically include improving model generalization performance, reducing computational complexity, mitigating the risk of overfitting (especially in high-dimensional datasets), and enhancing model interpretability. Within the PANDORA software, enabling the "Feature Selection" option initiates an automated procedure to determine an optimal feature subset prior to final model training.
