# Workspace

The Workspace is a space where you are able to upload your datasets for analysis using PANDORA. You are able to upload multiple files and you will be able to view all of them in this space. This is also the space where any files you save to PANDORA (e.g. saving your cluster classifications with the dataset) will show up.
